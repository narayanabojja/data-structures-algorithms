As the name suggests, a two-pointer approach uses two-pointers to find the answer to a problem in the optimal time. When the given data is present in a linear form i.e. in terms of an array, vector, linked list, etc we can use this approach.

This approach is very useful when you want to reduce the space complexity to constant but the state of time complexity still remains arbitrary i.e. it would reduce to a large extent or to a small extent.

An extra data structure can solve some problems with better time complexity but space complexity is increased which is a problem that could be addressed using this approach.

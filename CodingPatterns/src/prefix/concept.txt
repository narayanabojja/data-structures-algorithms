The "prefix sum" coding pattern is a technique in computer science where you pre-calculate 
the cumulative sum of elements in an array up to each index, allowing for quick calculation 
of the sum of any subarray within that array by simply subtracting the corresponding prefix sum 
values; essentially, it's a way to optimize repeated subarray sum calculations by doing 
the heavy lifting upfront.
